PSID : QXH02 :   Build an AI powered Smart Washing Machine which can do your Wardrobe Planning <br>
expectations;
Come up with the Machine Learning model, which can plan your Wardrobe based on the age of clothes.
Different parameters which can contribute to the cloth's ageing must be considered.
<br> 
 Solution : 
 The solution that we have come up with is an app called "WashMash" it is used to create a live tracking database of the number of days until which you clothes have to go for a wash again 
 this is possible by setting a set number of days for each type of clothing such as t-shirts,shirts, and jeans the basic essentials which everyone has . 
 After logging into the app you will be redirected to a page for adding the details of the clothes which you want to add to your virtual wardrobe aswell as the number of days ago it has been washed. This is
 essential to know when to place the same set of clothes after a specific numer of uses. In the future of our app we are looking forward to the usage of rfid stickers which are attached in the clothing along 
 with the tag which possesses the wash details of the the of fabric to give users an easier way to Add the clothing to the list as the clothng manufacturers can input the details such as thesize and the prefered wash type and the item code.
 After the item is used by the user for a set number of days they will recieve an alert notification and it wil also be available on the home page where the recenty washed items and the alerted items are dsplayed. 
 This type of scheduling will allow users to plan out the number of times they use the washing machines daily and will also reduce the load on the machine. This allows us to reduce the amount of water wasted in the
 daily usage of the washing machine .
